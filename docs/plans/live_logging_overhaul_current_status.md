# Live Logging Overhaul Current Status

Updated: 2026-07-11.

This is the compact operational source for the active logging-overhaul loop.
Read it before the historical progress ledger. Update it whenever the active
PR, head SHA, review gate, deployed SHA, VPS state, or next action changes.

## Goal

Deliver bounded, correlated, operator-useful live observability through small
reviewable PRs, current-head review gates, and evidence-based VPS5 validation.
Rust remains the trading-logic authority; observability must not become a
trading control plane.

Estimated completion:

- core event/observability architecture: about 85%
- original logging migration: about 70%
- expanded logging, performance-readiness, restart, and ops scope: about 65%
  overall, with substantial uncertainty from the intentionally growing backlog

## Active Review Slice

- PR #1189, `Record isolated-only entry filtering`, merged as
  `ff1b2c1f9ee9968a4e46f3ba598f3c7f091efe42` and was deployed to VPS5.
- Deployment smoke was green with all five supervised bots present and the
  unrelated `misc` process preserved. The new isolated-only reason had zero
  production matches because current configs do not exercise it.

Next action:

1. Review HSL replay scan-throughput observability: add scanned-row counters
   and scan-rate reporting, and correct ETA estimators while preserving replay
   behavior and existing applied-row metrics.

## Deployed Baseline

- Remote `v8`: `ff1b2c1f9ee9968a4e46f3ba598f3c7f091efe42`, PR #1189
- VPS5 repository: `ff1b2c1f9ee9968a4e46f3ba598f3c7f091efe42`, PR #1189; tracked status clean
- VPS5 expected bots: five; all running after the shared-code five-pane restart
- PR #1188 was approved on exact head `363eca852` by Hermes and Grok 4.5;
  CI passed and it merged as `bd169747`. VPS5 fast-forwarded cleanly and
  gracefully restarted only `passivbot:4.0`; Hyperliquid bot PID `842779` was
  replaced by `844272`, while the other four bot PIDs and unrelated
  `misc:0.0` PID `434835` remained unchanged. The unified account reached
  startup-ready in `48.00s` and full-warmup-ready in `74.77s`. A focused query
  found zero fatal HIP-3 compatibility events, as expected. The final settled
  smoke was hard-green with all five processes matched, `327/327` remote and
  `45/45` account-critical calls successful, states `R=4,S=1`, no
  uninterruptible sleep, no hard/log failures, and tracked repository status
  clean.
- PR #1187 was approved on exact head `74766c7cb` by Hermes, Grok 4.5, and the
  independent Codex reviewer; CI passed and it merged as `b99d1b05`. VPS5
  restarted only the five supervised bots, preserving `misc:0.0` PID `434835`.
  A bounded event query found the exact four expected per-side
  `config.market_compatibility` records: Binance `CRO,MNT` and OKX
  `KAS,MNT,XMR`, all non-hard degraded approved-list evidence. An immediate
  smoke caught a real KuCoin timeout; after it aged out, the settled smoke was
  hard-green with `370/370` remote and `26/26` account-critical calls
  successful, all five processes matched, states `R=4,S=1`, and no
  uninterruptible sleep.
- PR #1186 was approved on exact head `65d61702f` by Hermes, Grok 4.5, and the
  independent Codex reviewer that found both ordering regressions; CI passed
  and it merged as `b9748247`. VPS5 fast-forwarded without restarting bots.
  The exact bounded rotated `hsl_replay_profile` report returned `ok=true`,
  zero errors/warnings, and no resource-pressure crash. A settled two-minute
  smoke was hard-green with `216/216` remote and `56/56` account-critical calls
  successful, all five expected bots matched, and no text-log hard matches.
  The original five bot PIDs remained unchanged and returned to `Rl+`; unrelated
  `misc:0.0` remained PID `434835`. An earlier smoke window caught one real
  KuCoin timeout cycle, which aged out before the settled green window.
- PR #1184 was approved by Hermes and Grok 4.5 on exact head `9177dfed9`, CI
  passed, and it merged as `5526d5de`. VPS5 fast-forwarded cleanly while
  preserving untracked artifacts. The five old bots stopped after the second
  exact-pane Ctrl-C; only the `passivbot` session was reloaded, and unrelated
  `misc:0.0` remained PID `434835`.
- Immediate and fresh settled smoke reports were hard-green with all five
  expected bots matched and zero hard failures. The settled window recorded
  `249/249` successful remote and `34/34` account-critical calls, process states
  `R=4, S=1`, no uninterruptible sleep, and tracked repository status clean.
- All four coin-HSL replays completed with strategy `mixed` and candidate
  reduction from `86.865%` to `93.449%`: KuCoin `140.746s`, Binance `208.098s`,
  GateIO `229.248s`, and OKX `269.711s`. The post-PR #1183 baseline was
  `601.246s` to `2279.519s`, so the deployed replay is about `77%` to `89%`
  faster while preserving dense held/ambiguous pairs.
- PR #1181 required no restart; all five bot pane PIDs remained unchanged. Its
  bounded current-segment scorecard reported four compact full-replay
  completions from `453.98s` to `1728.585s`, but exposed the active slice's
  missing completion fallback for the rotated protective milestones.
- PR #1182 required no restart and recovered protective elapsed aggregates
  from explicit completion evidence without synthesizing milestone records.
  A fresh recovery smoke was green with `279/279` remote and `66/66`
  account-critical calls successful; all five expected bots matched.
- Preserve local/VPS configs, logs, monitor data, reports, and temporary files

## Review Gate

- Normal gate: all reviewers currently designated by the maintainer plus green
  CI on the exact head SHA.
- Temporary gate while Claude is rate-limited: Hermes + Grok 4.5 + green CI.
- Findings from any additional reviewer must still be verified and resolved.
- Any pushed delta requires current-head re-review.

## Agent Routing

- Sol: architecture, high-risk implementation, finding adjudication, merge,
  VPS signals/restart, and incident judgment.
- Terra: isolated low/medium-risk docs, tests, report/query tooling, and bounded
  observability implementation with explicit file scope.
- Luna or deterministic automation: metadata polling, state-change detection,
  CI/reviewer summaries, and read-only output parsing.
- Parallel PRs must be orthogonal. Dependent work waits for merge to `v8`.

## Next Slice

The coin-HSL protective-readiness split, cooperative background cadence,
current process-pressure query, compact cold replay payload, bounded replay
scorecard, stable per-pair fill index, exact sparse flat-pair replay, and the
rotated resource-pressure report fix, configured-market skip events, and fatal
HIP-3 startup compatibility are merged and deployed. The active slice makes
the isolated-only initial-entry filter visible in durable structured history.
Remaining candidates:

- HSL replay scan-throughput observability: scanned-row counters and rates plus
  corrected ETA estimators, while preserving replay behavior and existing
  applied-row metrics. This is selected for review; it is not yet complete.
- bounded operator tooling improvements sharing one code and validation surface

Do not create progress-only PRs or resume unrelated logging work from stale
worktrees.
