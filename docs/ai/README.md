## Adding New Documentation

**When to add new docs:**
- **Exchange quirks**: Add to `exchange_api_quirks.md` (or create `{exchange}_quirks.md` if extensive)
- **Complex debugging**: Add case study to `debugging_case_studies.md`
- **Architectural decision**: Add entry to `decisions.md`
- **Common pitfall discovered**: Add entry to `pitfalls.md`
- **New feature**: Create `features/{feature}.md` and update features/README.md

**Documentation principles:**
- Keep files focused on a single topic
- Use consistent formatting (see existing files as templates)
- Include concrete examples, not just abstract guidelines
- Reference code locations where applicable (`file.py:123`)
