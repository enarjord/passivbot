# Equity Hard Stop Loss Episode Contract

HSL drawdown state is scoped by `live.hsl_signal_mode`:

| Mode | Episode scope | Episode ends when |
|---|---|---|
| `coin` | one `coin+pside` | that position is fully closed |
| `pside` | all positions on one `pside` | every position on that side is fully closed |
| `unified` | the whole account | every position is fully closed |

## Invariants

1. The drawdown tracker resets after every proven episode end. The next episode begins after the
   flattening fill timestamp.
2. A flattening fill ends the episode regardless of its order type or origin. Panic, take-profit,
   grid-close, manual, and external exchange fills have identical boundary semantics.
3. A RED-seen episode remains entry-blocked until its scope is confirmed flat. Its cooldown begins
   at the flattening fill, not at the RED sample, order submission, bot restart, or observation time.
4. Compact replay derives non-flat/flat transitions from fill events independently of candle or
   unrealized-PnL availability. Missing price replay may defer drawdown evaluation, but it must not
   hide an episode boundary.
5. Current flat state is not a timestamp. If the flattening fill is not yet available, live
   finalization and cooldown anchoring defer visibly while protective entry blocking remains active;
   they never substitute the current time.
6. Restart reconstruction uses exchange state, fill/PnL history, candles where required, config, and
   current time. Local latch and replay-cache files are accelerators or diagnostics, not authority.

## Failure Semantics

Incomplete fill coverage follows `../error_contract.md`. A required episode boundary is unavailable
until supported by fill evidence. The affected HSL scope remains protective and retries after an
authoritative refresh; unrelated scopes remain available.

## Code And Tests

- Replay and live finalization: `src/passivbot_hsl.py`
- Live orchestration bindings: `src/passivbot.py`
- Coin replay and cooldown regressions: `tests/test_hsl_coin_mode.py`
- Pside/unified finalization coverage: `tests/test_unstucking_safeguards.py`

User-facing behavior and configuration are documented in `../../equity_hard_stop_loss.md` and
`../../equity_hard_stop_loss_cooldown_contracts.md`.
