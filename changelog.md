# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- One-way mode now respects disabled sides when choosing initial entry side, preventing a disabled side from blocking entries.
- Windows compatibility: cache folder names now replace `:` with `_` on Windows or when `WINDOWS_COMPATIBILITY=1` env var is set (#547, thanks @FelixJongleur42). **Note:** Existing Windows caches will be orphaned and re-downloaded.
- Pareto dashboard: fixed JavaScript callback errors when switching between tabs (#550, thanks @646826).

### Added
- `live.warmup_jitter_seconds` (default 30): random delay before warmup to prevent API rate limit storms when multiple bots start simultaneously.
- `live.max_concurrent_api_requests` (default null): optional global concurrency limit for CCXT API calls via CandlestickManager's network semaphore.
- `backtest.maker_fee_override` (default null): optional backtest/optimizer maker fee override (part-per-one) to replace exchange-derived fees.

## v7.6.1 - 2026-01-03

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for HLCV preparation module (16 tests covering 1,017 lines of production code)
- Added comprehensive orchestrator integration tests (19 tests for order accuracy, edge cases, multi-symbol coordination)
- Added warmup utilities test coverage (20 tests for EMA warmup calculations and edge cases)
- Improved Rust stub in conftest.py with correct parameter signatures and orchestrator JSON API support
- Total: 55 new tests, bringing test suite from ~420 to 477 passing tests

## v7.6.0 - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Shared Pareto core (`pareto_core.py`) with constraint-aware dominance, crowding, and extreme-preserving pruning; reused by ParetoStore.
- Canonical suite metrics payload now shared by backtest and optimizer; suite summaries include the same schema as Pareto members.
- Targeted Pareto tests to ensure consistency.
- KuCoin exchange-config regression tests covering hedge-mode setup and leverage/margin configuration (guards CCXT upgrades).
- Pareto explorer: added configurable “Closest config metrics” dropdown so users can choose which metrics are shown in the Closest Config table, defaulting to scoring/limit metrics.
- `live.balance_override` setting/CLI flag to pin balance to a fixed value instead of fetching from the exchange (off by default).
- Fill events manager: added Gate.io support via ccxt trade fetcher.
- Rust build pipeline: pre-import staleness checks with skip/force/fail flags, shared helpers, and a `scripts/check_rust_extension.py` reporter; added tests for staleness detection.
- Rust compile flow now less noisy in normal operation (debug lock prints removed); compile attempts still logged when rebuilding.
- Balance hysteresis now applied centrally in core bot update_balance; exchange fetch_balance implementations return raw balances.
- Added configurable `live.balance_hysteresis_snap_pct` (default 0.02); set 0.0 to disable balance hysteresis entirely.
- Optimizer: bounds now support optional step size `[low, high, step]` for grid-based optimization; stepped parameters stay on-grid through sampling, crossover/mutation, and Pareto storage.
- Live: added `live.candle_lock_timeout_seconds` to control how long CandlestickManager waits for per-symbol candle locks when multiple bot instances share the same cache (default 10s).
- Rust orchestrator JSON API for unified order planning across live and backtest.
- Backtest HLCV preparation pipeline now routes through CandlestickManager with shared warmup utilities.

### Changed
- Backtest fills now include signed `wallet_exposure` and `twe_long`/`twe_short`/`twe_net` (replacing the previous `total_wallet_exposure` fill column).
- Pareto explorer: default metrics for X/Y/histogram, scenario comparison, param scatter, correlation heatmap, and Closest Config now derive from `config.optimize.scoring` and `config.optimize.limits` instead of first-alphabetical metrics; Closest Config table no longer shows raw *_mean/_min/_max/_std stat columns by default.
- Suite summaries are leaner: redundant metric dumps removed; canonical metrics schema persisted alongside per-scenario timing.
- Pareto pruning preserves per-objective extremes when enforcing max size.
- Hyperliquid combined balance/position caching test isolated stubs to avoid polluting the rest of the suite.
- Separated `fetch_positions` and `fetch_balance` responsibilities across all exchange wrappers (each now returns only positions or only balance) and added `update_positions_and_balance()` helper in the core bot to refresh both concurrently.
- `update_positions_and_balance()` now runs balance and positions concurrently, logs position changes after both complete, and then emits a single balance-change event so equity logging always uses fresh positions.
- KuCoin `get_order_execution_params` now aligns with the latest CCXT payload requirements so orders always include the correct margin/position parameters after the CCXT upgrade.
- Added Pareto regression test to ensure per-metric extremes remain present after front pruning.
- Metric adg_pnl now includes fees paid, effectively making it net pnl instead of gross pnl.
- Risk management docs refreshed and consolidated; new notes on unstucking, WEL/TWEL enforcers, and conditional stop-loss concepts.
- Balance updates now keep the previous value on fetch failures (no more transient zero balances); warnings are logged and the standard restart-on-errors flow handles persistent issues.
- EMA log spam reduced: volume/log-range EMA summaries only emit when rankings change, keeping live logs quieter.
- Suite configuration is canonical under `backtest.suite` for both backtesting and optimizer runs; `optimize.suite` (if present) is ignored and removed during config normalization.
- Live orchestrator compare mode now derives all EMA inputs from a single per-symbol candle snapshot (1m + 1h), reducing redundant candle-lock contention and false compare failures in multi-bot deployments.
- Live order generation now runs exclusively through the Rust orchestrator; legacy Python order planning paths are removed.
