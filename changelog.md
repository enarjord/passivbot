# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Shared Pareto core (`pareto_core.py`) with constraint-aware dominance, crowding, and extreme-preserving pruning; reused by ParetoStore.
- Canonical suite metrics payload now shared by backtest and optimizer; suite summaries include the same schema as Pareto members.
- Targeted Pareto tests to ensure consistency.

### Changed
- Suite summaries are leaner: redundant metric dumps removed; canonical metrics schema persisted alongside per-scenario timing.
- Pareto pruning preserves per-objective extremes when enforcing max size.
- Hyperliquid combined balance/position caching test isolated stubs to avoid polluting the rest of the suite.
