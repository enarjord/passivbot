# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Shared Pareto core (`pareto_core.py`) with constraint-aware dominance, crowding, and extreme-preserving pruning; reused by ParetoStore.
- Canonical suite metrics payload now shared by backtest and optimizer; suite summaries include the same schema as Pareto members.
- Targeted Pareto tests to ensure consistency.
- KuCoin exchange-config regression tests covering hedge-mode setup and leverage/margin configuration (guards CCXT upgrades).

### Changed
- Suite summaries are leaner: redundant metric dumps removed; canonical metrics schema persisted alongside per-scenario timing.
- Pareto pruning preserves per-objective extremes when enforcing max size.
- Hyperliquid combined balance/position caching test isolated stubs to avoid polluting the rest of the suite.
- Separated `fetch_positions` and `fetch_balance` responsibilities across all exchange wrappers (each now returns only positions or only balance) and added `update_positions_and_balance()` helper in the core bot to refresh both concurrently.
- `update_positions_and_balance()` now runs balance and positions concurrently, logs position changes after both complete, and then emits a single balance-change event so equity logging always uses fresh positions.
- KuCoin `get_order_execution_params` now aligns with the latest CCXT payload requirements so orders always include the correct margin/position parameters after the CCXT upgrade.
