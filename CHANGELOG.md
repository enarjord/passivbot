# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- **Combined OHLCV normalization source selection** - Volume normalization in combined backtests now uses each coin's OHLCV source exchange (`ohlcv_source`) instead of the market-settings exchange when `backtest.market_settings_sources` differs from OHLCV routing.
- **Config template/format preservation** - Added `live.enable_archive_candle_fetch` to the template defaults and ensured `backtest.market_settings_sources` is preserved during config formatting.
- **Live no-fill minute EMA continuity** - When finalized 1m candles are missing because no trades occurred, live runtime now materializes synthetic zero-candles in memory (not on disk), preventing avoidable `MissingEma` loop errors on illiquid symbols. If real candles arrive later, they overwrite synthetic runtime candles and invalidate EMA cache automatically.

## v7.8.2 - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Configurable candle interval** - New `backtest.candle_interval_minutes` setting (default 1) aggregates 1m candles to coarser intervals (e.g., 5m) for faster backtests and optimizer iterations. EMA alphas are automatically adjusted for the interval. Trade-off: intra-interval fill ordering is lost.
- **High-exposure duration metrics** - New backtest metrics `high_exposure_hours_{mean,max}_{long,short}` measuring continuous durations where total wallet exposure exceeded its daily average. Available for optimization scoring and limit checks.
- **Total wallet exposure plot** - Backtests now output `total_wallet_exposure.png` showing long TWE (positive, blue) and short TWE (negative, red) over time.
- **External OHLCV source dir** - New `backtest.ohlcv_source_dir` config option to load 1m candle data from a pre-populated directory tree before falling back to exchange archives. Supports both `.npy` and `.npz` file formats.

### Fixed
- **OHLCV source-dir fallback behavior** - Non-contiguous source-dir candle data now falls back to CandlestickManager instead of propagating gappy series into downstream strict continuity checks.

### Fixed
- **Short-only exposure metrics** - `total_wallet_exposure_max` and related metrics now use absolute values, correctly reporting exposure magnitude for short-only configs where `twe_net` is negative.
- **Timestamp day bucketing** - Backtest analysis now initializes daily bucketing from the first timestamp, preventing a phantom first-day sample when using aggregated candle intervals.
- **Forager fills plots with aggregated candles** - `fills_plots` now use the effective candle stream from the executed backtest, keeping fills aligned when `backtest.candle_interval_minutes > 1`.

### Changed
- **Template config tuning** - Updated `configs/template.json` optimization bounds/scenarios and backtest defaults (`btc_collateral_cap`, `maker_fee_override`, optimize limits).

## v7.8.1 - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Gate.io cache cutoff** - Set `GATEIO_CACHE_CUTOFF_DATE` to 2026-02-07 so stale Gate.io caches are quarantined on startup.

## v7.8.0 - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Live bot candle cache** - Rebuilds candlestick index metadata for the required warmup ranges on startup, preventing stale `index.json` metadata from suppressing candle refreshes.
- **Windows backtest startup** - Avoids importing `resource` at module load, preventing crashes on Windows during backtest/optimizer startup.
- **Legacy cache migration** - Migration now runs once globally and covers all exchanges on first init (not just the first exchange to start), and legacy data is resolved relative to the cache root to avoid unintended copies.
- **Combined OHLCV selection** - `market_settings_sources` no longer expands OHLCV candidates; combined data now uses `backtest.exchanges` plus forced coin sources only.

### Changed
- **Logging** - Reduced INFO/WARNING noise (unsupported market notices now INFO with `[config]`, hedge-mode success logs moved to DEBUG, Bitget OHLCV limit probes moved to DEBUG, KuCoin PnL discrepancy warnings further throttled, large zero-candle warnings now only trigger above 1000). Added `[order]` tag to order plan summaries and extra context for MissingEma errors.

## v7.7.1 - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Stock perps (HIP-3) support** - Hyperliquid stock perpetuals are now supported, including symbol normalization and routing in combined mode.
- **Pareto host** - Added a lightweight host mode for serving Pareto outputs.

### Fixed
- **Combined HLCV prep** - Fixed `orig_coins` NameError during combined data preparation.

### Changed
- **Logging refinements** - Further reduced INFO noise and improved context across rounds 8–10.
- **Agent docs** - Updated guidance and pitfalls documentation for cross-platform portability.

## v7.7.0 - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Bybit: Missing PnL on some close fills** - Fixed pagination bug in `BybitFetcher._fetch_positions_history()` that caused closed-pnl records to be skipped when >100 records existed in a time window. Now uses hybrid pagination: cursor-based for recent records (no gaps), time-based sliding window for older records.

### Added
- **Fill events now include psize/pprice** - Each fill event is annotated with position size (`psize`) and VWAP entry price (`pprice`) after the fill. Values are computed using a two-phase algorithm and persisted to cache for all exchanges.
- **Logging best practices documentation** - New `docs/ai/log_analysis_prompt.md` with comprehensive logging guidelines, level definitions, and improvement tracking.
- **Exchange API quirks documentation** - New `docs/ai/exchange_api_quirks.md` documenting known exchange-specific limitations and workarounds.
- **Debugging case studies** - New `docs/ai/debugging_case_studies.md` with detailed debugging sessions as reference.

### Changed
- **Logging improvements (7 rounds of refinement)**:
  - Standardized log tags: `[memory]`, `[warmup]`, `[hourly]`, `[fills]`, `[mapping]`, `[candle]`, `[ranking]`, `[mode]`
  - Moved routine API/cache messages from INFO to DEBUG level (CCXT fetch details, cache updates)
  - Moved CCXT API payloads from DEBUG to TRACE level
  - EMA ranking logs now throttled to every 5 minutes (was every cycle)
  - Mode changes throttled to 2 minutes per symbol (reduces forager oscillation noise)
  - KucoinFetcher PnL discrepancy warnings throttled to 1 hour with delta-based deduplication
  - WebSocket reconnection now logs explicit `[ws] reconnecting...` messages
  - Strict mode gaps changed from WARNING to DEBUG (expected for illiquid markets)
  - Persistent gaps changed from WARNING to INFO with throttling
  - Zero-candle synthesis warnings aggregated and rate-limited
- **PnL tracking now uses FillEventsManager exclusively** - Legacy `update_pnls` path removed. FillEventsManager provides more accurate fill tracking with proper event deduplication, canonical schemas, and exchange-specific fetchers for all supported exchanges.
- Fill events are now stored in `caches/fill_events/{exchange}/{user}/` instead of the old `caches/{exchange}/{user}_pnls.json` format. Existing legacy cache files are ignored; FillEventsManager will rebuild from exchange API on first run.
- Unstuck allowances now computed from FillEventsManager data instead of legacy pnls list.
- Trailing position change timestamps now derived from FillEventsManager events.

### Removed
- `--shadow-mode` CLI flag (no longer needed; FillEventsManager is production-ready)
- `live.pnls_manager_shadow_mode` config option
- Legacy `init_pnls`, `update_pnls`, `fetch_pnls` methods in passivbot.py
- Legacy `init_fill_events`, `update_fill_events`, `fetch_fill_events` methods (dead code)
- Shadow mode comparison logging (`_compare_pnls_shadow`, etc.)

### Migration Notes
- **No action required** - FillEventsManager automatically fetches and caches fill data
- Old `{user}_pnls.json` cache files can be safely deleted after upgrading
- If using custom exchange configurations, ensure the exchange's fill fetcher is supported (Binance, Bybit, Bitget, GateIO, Hyperliquid, KuCoin, OKX)

## v7.6.2 - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- One-way mode now respects disabled sides when choosing initial entry side, preventing a disabled side from blocking entries.
- Startup banner now dynamically calculates width to prevent misaligned borders.
- Bybit leverage/margin mode "not modified" errors now handled gracefully instead of logging full tracebacks.
- Large warmup spans (>2 days) now properly trigger gap-filling via CCXT even when end_ts touches present, fixing issue where thousands of zero-candles were synthesized for historical gaps.
- Windows compatibility: cache folder names now replace `:` with `_` on Windows or when `WINDOWS_COMPATIBILITY=1` env var is set (#547, thanks @FelixJongleur42). **Note:** Existing Windows caches will be orphaned and re-downloaded.
- Pareto dashboard: fixed JavaScript callback errors when switching between tabs (#550, thanks @646826).

### Changed
- Config modification logs now prefixed with `[config]` for easier filtering (e.g., `[config] changed live.user bybit_01 -> gateio_01`).
- Zero-candle synthesis logs are now rate-limited to at most once per minute per symbol, reducing log spam.
- Zero-candle logs now include human-readable UTC timestamps showing which candles were synthesized (e.g., `synthesized 3 zero-candles at 2026-01-19T22:15 to 2026-01-19T22:17`).
- Synthetic candles are now tracked at runtime; when real data arrives for a previously-synthetic timestamp, the EMA cache is automatically invalidated and will be recomputed on next cycle.
- FillEventsManager logs now prefixed with `[fills]` for easier filtering; verbose refresh logs consolidated into single summary line (e.g., `[fills] refresh: events=1311 (+1) | persisted 2 days (2026-01-19, 2026-01-20)`).
- BybitFetcher residual PnL warnings reduced to debug level with compact summary (was logging all order IDs every cycle at WARNING level).
- Health summary now includes realized PnL sum when fills > 0 (e.g., `fills=3 (pnl=+12.50)`).
- Startup banner now shows "TWEL" (Total Wallet Exposure Limit) instead of "Exposure" to clarify it's a limit, not current exposure; long+short mode shows both limits (e.g., `TWEL: L:125% S:85%`).
- Synthetic candle replacement logs now prefixed with `[candle]` for easier filtering.

### Added
- `openpyxl` added to `requirements-live.txt` (required for Bitget archive XLSX parsing).
- `CandlestickManager.needs_ema_recompute(symbol)`: check if EMAs should be recomputed due to synthetic→real data replacement.
- `CandlestickManager.clear_synthetic_tracking(symbol)`: clear synthetic timestamp tracking after warmup completes.
- `live.warmup_jitter_seconds` (default 30): random delay before warmup to prevent API rate limit storms when multiple bots start simultaneously.
- `live.max_concurrent_api_requests` (default null): optional global concurrency limit for CCXT API calls via CandlestickManager's network semaphore.
- `backtest.maker_fee_override` (default null): optional backtest/optimizer maker fee override (part-per-one) to replace exchange-derived fees.
- `live.enable_archive_candle_fetch` (default false): opt-in to use exchange archive data for candle fetching in live bots; disabled by default to avoid potential timeout issues. Backtester always enables archive fetching regardless of this setting.

## v7.6.1 - 2026-01-03

### Testing
- Added comprehensive test coverage for HLCV preparation module (16 tests covering 1,017 lines of production code)
- Added comprehensive orchestrator integration tests (19 tests for order accuracy, edge cases, multi-symbol coordination)
- Added warmup utilities test coverage (20 tests for EMA warmup calculations and edge cases)
- Improved Rust stub in conftest.py with correct parameter signatures and orchestrator JSON API support
- Total: 55 new tests, bringing test suite from ~420 to 477 passing tests

## v7.6.0 - 2026-01-03

### Added
- Shared Pareto core (`pareto_core.py`) with constraint-aware dominance, crowding, and extreme-preserving pruning; reused by ParetoStore.
- Canonical suite metrics payload now shared by backtest and optimizer; suite summaries include the same schema as Pareto members.
- Targeted Pareto tests to ensure consistency.
- KuCoin exchange-config regression tests covering hedge-mode setup and leverage/margin configuration (guards CCXT upgrades).
- Pareto explorer: added configurable “Closest config metrics” dropdown so users can choose which metrics are shown in the Closest Config table, defaulting to scoring/limit metrics.
- `live.balance_override` setting/CLI flag to pin balance to a fixed value instead of fetching from the exchange (off by default).
- Fill events manager: added Gate.io support via ccxt trade fetcher.
- Rust build pipeline: pre-import staleness checks with skip/force/fail flags, shared helpers, and a `scripts/check_rust_extension.py` reporter; added tests for staleness detection.
- Rust compile flow now less noisy in normal operation (debug lock prints removed); compile attempts still logged when rebuilding.
- Balance hysteresis now applied centrally in core bot update_balance; exchange fetch_balance implementations return raw balances.
- Added configurable `live.balance_hysteresis_snap_pct` (default 0.02); set 0.0 to disable balance hysteresis entirely.
- Optimizer: bounds now support optional step size `[low, high, step]` for grid-based optimization; stepped parameters stay on-grid through sampling, crossover/mutation, and Pareto storage.
- Live: added `live.candle_lock_timeout_seconds` to control how long CandlestickManager waits for per-symbol candle locks when multiple bot instances share the same cache (default 10s).
- Rust orchestrator JSON API for unified order planning across live and backtest.
- Backtest HLCV preparation pipeline now routes through CandlestickManager with shared warmup utilities.

### Changed
- Backtest fills now include signed `wallet_exposure` and `twe_long`/`twe_short`/`twe_net` (replacing the previous `total_wallet_exposure` fill column).
- Pareto explorer: default metrics for X/Y/histogram, scenario comparison, param scatter, correlation heatmap, and Closest Config now derive from `config.optimize.scoring` and `config.optimize.limits` instead of first-alphabetical metrics; Closest Config table no longer shows raw *_mean/_min/_max/_std stat columns by default.
- Suite summaries are leaner: redundant metric dumps removed; canonical metrics schema persisted alongside per-scenario timing.
- Pareto pruning preserves per-objective extremes when enforcing max size.
- Hyperliquid combined balance/position caching test isolated stubs to avoid polluting the rest of the suite.
- Separated `fetch_positions` and `fetch_balance` responsibilities across all exchange wrappers (each now returns only positions or only balance) and added `update_positions_and_balance()` helper in the core bot to refresh both concurrently.
- `update_positions_and_balance()` now runs balance and positions concurrently, logs position changes after both complete, and then emits a single balance-change event so equity logging always uses fresh positions.
- KuCoin `get_order_execution_params` now aligns with the latest CCXT payload requirements so orders always include the correct margin/position parameters after the CCXT upgrade.
- Added Pareto regression test to ensure per-metric extremes remain present after front pruning.
- Metric adg_pnl now includes fees paid, effectively making it net pnl instead of gross pnl.
- Risk management docs refreshed and consolidated; new notes on unstucking, WEL/TWEL enforcers, and conditional stop-loss concepts.
- Balance updates now keep the previous value on fetch failures (no more transient zero balances); warnings are logged and the standard restart-on-errors flow handles persistent issues.
- EMA log spam reduced: volume/log-range EMA summaries only emit when rankings change, keeping live logs quieter.
- Suite configuration is canonical under `backtest.suite` for both backtesting and optimizer runs; `optimize.suite` (if present) is ignored and removed during config normalization.
- Live orchestrator compare mode now derives all EMA inputs from a single per-symbol candle snapshot (1m + 1h), reducing redundant candle-lock contention and false compare failures in multi-bot deployments.
- Live order generation now runs exclusively through the Rust orchestrator; legacy Python order planning paths are removed.
